9._4 Update abstract method

    Feat > Update MovieRepository abstract method return types

        * Path:
            api/repository/movie/abstractions.py

        * Problem:
            - To pass unit test, I modified the methods in the Implementation class for MovieRepository(abc.ABC),
                especially their return types and return type hinting
            - These changes should also be applied to another Implementation class that I am going to create
            - Therefore, I updated the abstract class based on 'MemoryMovieRepository(MovieRepository)'
                in the api/repository/movie/movie.py module

        * Updated:
            - The return types for methods in the MovieRepository class to make them more specific
            - The `create_movie`, `update_movie`, and `delete_movie` methods now return `typing.Optional[Movie]`
                to indicate that they may return `None` on failure,
                as same as the `get_by_id` and `get_by_title` methods
            - These changes improve the clarity and accuracy of the method signatures
